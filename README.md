# Cash_Register
This is a script for a cash register. It creates a panel where you can see and manipulate the cash you have on your store, restaurant or similar. You can manipulate exchanges where physical money is being used.
Here, is used the values of coins and notes from the Brazilian monetary unit, the Real. Decimal values and the value 1 is used with coins, and the rest is with notes.
By default, the script considers that the register has 100 units of each coin and note, but you can change that inside the panel, or directly from the txt file.
In the case of a transition that's impossibile (for example, you don't have the exacly exchange needed), the user can make the necessary manipulations direcly on the panel, instead of letting the script calculate the correct change.
